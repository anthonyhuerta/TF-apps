When using this root module for your own environment in a shared account you'll want to create the files `localdev.auto.tfvars` and `localdev._overrride.tf` inside the `src` directory. This directory contains examples that you can use as a starting point for your own.

Note: Outside of this directory any files starting with `localdev*` will be ignored by git.
